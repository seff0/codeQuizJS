## Description

This code quiz was built using vanilla JavaScript. The quiz is 5 questions, multiple choice, and 30 seconds long. The application selects a question object from an array and displays it on screen as a text question and four multiple choice buttons. If you guess correctly, the button triggers the next question. If you guess incorrectly, 5 seconds are deducted and then the next question is displayed. At the end of the game, the user is prompted to save their score, which is placed in local storage and can be viewed with the Highscores button.
